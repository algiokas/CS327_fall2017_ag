Homework 3 Readme

- Dungeon distance maps are fully implemented at time of writing

- I didn't implement a switch to place the PC at a specific location. on line 564 of dungeon.c
  there is a commented line that should allow you to place the PC at a specific location (sorry)

- I have implemented a --DEBUG switch that will output all of the optional debug output in the code
  some of it is more readable than some other parts, but it's mainly for my personal use
