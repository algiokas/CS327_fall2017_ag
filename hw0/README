- I regret not having to spoken to someone about the exact spec for this assignment earlier
  however I found it to be very confusing.

- My simulation simply runs 1000 iterations of the sandpile at 10 iterations per second

- I implemented a simple array based integer queue in a seperate file that tracks the unstable piles

- My confusion mainly arose from figuring out what a single "step" in the simulation is

- In my code, a "step" occurs every time a grain of sand is placed, and all subsequent domino-effect
  changes are considered part of that same step

- I did not check for stability every step since the way my code is implemented, stability is
  reached during every step
