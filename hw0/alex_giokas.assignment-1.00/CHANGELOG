Changelog

Tuesday August 22nd
- Created sandpile.c

- Added relevant global variables: width, height and world[][]

- implemented initialize_world() to take command line input and salt the world

- implemented print_world() to display the world state to the console

- Implemented main function that initializes and prints initial world state

Thursday August 24th
- Created queue.c and queue.h

- added standard function prototypes for a queue in queue.h

- attempted to implement basic integer queue, created testqueue.c (not included in assignment)

Tuesday August 29th
- Completed implementation of queue functions

- queue can read in integers and read them back in correct order, other functions also working 

- Implemented add_sand() functin in sandpile.c to add a single grain of sand

- implemented unstable queue in sandpile.c that stores the positions of any unstable piles

- implemented update_world() in sandpile.c which reads the queue and just decreases pile heigh

- implemented topple_pile() in sandpile.c which reduces the height of a pile by 4 and places
  1 sand grain in each of the adjacent cells, unless those cells are edges

- update_world() now calls topple pile() and can correctly simulate a single central pile

- after reaching the point where each pile adjacent to the center topples, the entire simulation
  breaks

Wednesday August 30th
- fixed add_sand() and topple_pile() so that they only add unstable piles to the queue once per
  cycle

- print_world() now displays the iteration number of the world at the top of the printout

- created changelog file

- Created Readme file

- note: I created this file after writing the entire assignment so all prior changes are
  just a simple overview of what order I did things in
