HW6 Readme

- I attempted to rewrite as much of my project as possible entirely in C++

- A lot of changes were made in the name of using C++ style and idioms rather than those of C

- Almost all cases of static arrays use the std::array<> container, and almost all cases of dynamic arrays
  use the std::vector<> container
  
- I completely ran out of time, so my code is not only incomplete as per the spec
  but has a ton of memory leaks that I was unable to diagnose since I actually never use "new" at all

- The code will run and will display the ncurses based dungeon map, no input is detected other than
  'q' to quit
