Homework 9 Readme

- Basic combat is implemented, attacking an enemy will deal
  damage based on the player's attacking die

- AI is currently broken so monsters do not move, they can
  be attacked and killed, but do not do anything
  
- Item pickup is implemented, as well as inventory and 
  equipment viewing using 'i' and 'e' respectively
  
- Equipping/unequipping items works

- Dropping and expunging items works. I don't have items
  stacks implemented so when I drop an item it simply drops
  in an open adjacent or diagonally adjacent space. When
  the entire 3x3 grid around which the PC is standing is
  filled with items, item dropping is disabled.
  
- Item inspection basically works, although it isn't very
  nice to look at.
  
- For any of the above "menu functions", giving an input
  that has no effect (such as trying to drop from an empty
  slot) may not close the window immediately. However,
  additional button presses will act as normal move commands
  which may add a delay to the game state. In order to avoid this
  generally use the 's' key to close any windows.
  
- Spongebob is not currently designated as a "boss" in any
  way, so the game still just ends when 0 NPCs remain
