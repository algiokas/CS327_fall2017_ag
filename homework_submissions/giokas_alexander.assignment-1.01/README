- At time of writing this, room generation and dungeon display is working, corridor generation
  is not working

- In my implementation, the dungeon is made up of multiple floors. Each generated map represents a
  single floor. In the future I plan to have a dungeon struct that stores multiple floors

- I added an upper limit of 15 to the number of rooms that can be in a dungeon. I also implemented
  the "generate rooms until at least 7% of the dungeon is filled" suggestion from the spec. 
  In practice the number of rooms rarely reaches 15, and usually hovers around 7-10

- Each cell in my implementation has a type and a hardness, the types are enumerated by an enum
  called CellType. This is not strictly enforced anywhere, but my implementation sets hardness
  values between 0 and 10. Hardness of 0 refers to "open" space such as rooms and corridors, while
  hardness 10 refers to the outer, immutable cells. values 1-9 refer to rock

- I implemented a simple corridor generation algorithm that takes a 2 part horizontal+vertical
  path with a single right angle turn if necessary. This does not fully work yet, as sometimes
  a room will not be connected to the rest of the dungeon
