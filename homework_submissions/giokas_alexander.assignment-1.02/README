Homework 2 Readme

- Command line parsing, dungeon saving and dungeon loading are fully implemented and working

- The system running this program is assumed to be little endian, as an explicit byte swap is
  performed on the version and size headers

- At time of writing, the program has been checked with valgrind and has no memory leaks

- Although this was part of the last assignment, I implemented dijkstra corridor generation
  which was not implemented for 1.01
