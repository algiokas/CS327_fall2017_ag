Homework 3 Readme

- Dungeon distance maps are fully implemented at time of writing

- I didn't implement a switch to place the PC at a specific location. on line 564 of dungeon.c
  there is a commented line that should allow you to place the PC at a specific location (sorry)

- I have implemented a --DEBUG switch that will output all of the optional debug output in the code
  some of it is more readable than some other parts, but it's mainly for my personal use

- I've updated and cleaned up my makefile and added some additional functionality and flexibility

- The makefile has a clean macro that will remove everything but source and header files by running
  "make clean" (no quotes) on the command line
